        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h3>Abstract</h3>

 

        Sketch based image retrieval systems have many applications in daily life like
        Medical diagnosis, digital library, search engines, crime prevention,
        photo sharing sites, geographical information, and sensing remote
        systems. The traditional text-based image retrieval systems are limited
        as with growing database of images it is difficult and unrealistic to
        annotate all the images for text-based search.
        <br>
        In order to tackle this problem, we build a pipeline combining preprocessing the images (gray scaling edge extraction) and extracting various feature descriptors (SIFT, HOG, and Hu Moments)
        from the images. Then, we take the extracted features from a input sketch and fetch the most similar k images from the database based on distance metrics corresponding to each type of feature descriptors.
        <br>
        Based on the test dataset which contains 50-50 images from two different categories, we were able to achieve above baseline accuracy (50%) from all three descriptors what we implemented. Our next step will be to try to tweak the parameters of these feature extractors and to try out strategies to combine the features in order to improve the overall performance.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        The traditional text-based image retrieval systems are limited as with growing database of images it is difficult and unrealistic to annotate all the images for text-based search. Using sketch to retrieve images also alleviates the need for generating accurate captions for existing images, which becomes a complex natural language processing problem as the description is required to be more specific and detailed. Sketches have a much greater potential to describe the content and exact details of the image than plain text and are a more direct way of expressing human thoughts than text abstraction.<br>
        Sketch based image retrieval systems have many applications in daily life like Medical diagnosis, digital library, search engines, crime prevention, photo sharing sites, geographical information, and sensing remote systems. With the increasing use of touch screen devices, Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (SBIR) has relevant applications in e-commerce platforms also. <br>
        Currently we are with regular RBG photographs, but the skeches are only black and white.
        We are not designming any new way to solve this problem, but building from scratch using knowledge we obtained from class lectures and reseaches.<br>


        <!-- Approach -->
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        In our approach, we aim to tackle the following aspects of sketch-image
        differences:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Visual Cue Imbalance:</b> The sketches have a holistic shape
                and salient local shapes while the images are abundant in
                details on shape, texture, and color.
            </li>
            <li><b>Abstraction Gap:</b> The sketches are usually simplified
                version (missing details) of images with random distortion (the
                randomness in strokes) and unrealistic disproportion (object
                parts being unrealistically smaller or bigger).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img style="height: 250px;" alt=""
                 src="proposal_approach_flow_diagram.png">
        </div>
        The whole SBIR framework can be divided into two phases- pre-processing
        and retrieval. The framework is shown in the above figure.
        <h4>Pre-Processing Phase</h4>
        In this phase, we pre-process the dataset to extract features. For
        every image in the dataset, we perform the following steps.
        <h5>Feature/Edge extraction</h5>
        Convert the image to its gray intensity representation. Extract local edge or global shape features 
        and encode them in a feature vector using representations like histogram.
        The histogram based features are efficient for similarity comparison 
        and they can also tolerate random distortions in the sketches
        due to the grid division scheme in feature extraction.
        Edge/shape extraction addresses the visual cue imbalance. Since the sketches
        are generally composed of strokes which are mostly edges, it is
        intuitive to compare edge maps of images with sketches. This also addresses
        the simplification sub-aspect of the abstraction gap. 
        Some of the feature extraction methods we have tried are described below.
        <ol>
            <b> <li>  HOG - Histogram of Oriented Gradients  </li> </b>
            
            <b> <li> SIFT  </li> </b> The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), is a local feature descriptor. By searching for blobs at multiple scales and positions, the SIFT detector is invariant (or, more accurately, covariant) to translation, rotations, and re scaling of the image. We use Euclidean distance measure to compute similarity between sketches and images in database.
            <b> <li> Hu Moments </li> </b>
            Hu Moments generates descriptors based on the outer contours of an shape. It is invariant to translation, size and rotation. 
            We consider this a global shape feature descriptor.
        </ol>
        <h4>Retrieval Phase</h4>
        This is the phase in which the query image is processed to retrieve
        similar images.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Feature extraction</b></li>
            Similar to the feature extraction step of the pre-processing phase,
            we extract features from the input sketch image and form a feature vector.
            <li><b>Similarity comparison</b></li>
            <ol>
                <b> <li> L2 Norm </li> </b> 
                L2 Norm/Euclidean distance metric is used to compare the features extracted using SIFT and Hu Moments.
                <b> <li> L1 Norm </li> </b>
                L1 Norm/Manhattan/Cityblock distance metric is used to compare the features extracted using HOG.
                <br> <br> 
                We chose the distance metrics as per [5] which says that Manhattan distance (L1 norm) may be
                preferable to Euclidean distance (L2 norm) for the case of high dimensional data. As described in 
                the approach section above, HOG features' dimensions are significantly higher than that of SIFT and Hu Moments.  

            </ol>
         <br>
            The top 'k' similar images from the above step are retrieved as
            output.
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Experiments and Results</h3>
        
        <h4>Experimental Setup</h4>
            <li><b>Dataset Used: </b><b>The Shoe Dataset</b><br>
                This dataset is organized into two categories of photos and sketches - shoe and chair and has a total of 1,432 sketch-photo pairs. Images and sketches are of the scale and orientation.<br> 
                <a href="https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~qian/Project_cvpr16.html">https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~qian/Project_cvpr16.html</a>
                <br>
                We first start with the two category dataset <b>Shoe</b> for
                    our problem, to test our features.</li>
            <li><b>Input</b><br>
                200 images of shoes and 200 images of chairs.

            <li><b>Output</b><br>
                200 sketches of shoes and 200 sketches of chairs as query sketches.
            </li>
        <br>
        <h4>Evaluation metrics</h4>
                We will be evaluating the performance of our system (different descriptors and different parameters) using the
                below metrics.

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Precision at k:</b> For a given query sketch image,
                        precision at k images (P@k) is (e.g., P@10 or
                        "Precision at 10") corresponds to the number of
                        relevant images among the top k images retrieved.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Average Precision at k per category:</b> We evaluate
                        the performance of our system for each category of
                        images in the dataset using this metric. Calculate P@k
                        for each sketch image in the category and return the
                        average of P@k scores.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Average Precision at k per dataset:</b>
                        Every sketch image in the dataset as query image and
                        return the average of P@k score for each query.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Recall at k:</b> For a given query sketch image,
                        recall at k images (R@k) is (e.g., R@10 or "Recall at
                        10") corresponds to the fraction of the number of
                        relevant images retrieved from the total relevant
                        images.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Average Recall at k per category:</b>
                        We evaluate the performance of our system for each
                        category of images in the dataset using this metric.
                        Calculate R@k for each sketch image in the category and
                        return the average of R@k scores.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Average Recall at k per dataset:</b>
                        Every sketch image in the dataset as query image and
                        return the average of R@k score for each query.
                    </li>
                </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Baseline</h4>
            Since we have a 50/50 divide in the candidate images of the two catogories, the baseline of our approach will be 0.5.           
            
        
        </ol>
        <h3>Qualitative results</h3>

        <h3>Conclusion and future work</h3>
        We will be evaluating the performance of our current implementation of framework 
        and feature extractors (HOG, SIFT and Hu Moments)
        with <a href="http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/explore/banana.html"> The Sketchy Database </a>
        which is the first large-scale collection of sketch-photo pairs. The
        dataset has 125 categories of objects with 100 images
        per category and 75,471 sketches of 12,500 objects. Unlike the shoe dataset, 
        this database is benchmarked for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval 
        that is used to embed images and sketches of different scales and orientations 
        in the same feature space using convolutional networks. Since the highly performing 
        feature descriptor HOG is not rotation-scale invariant, we will try cascading the
        weak but rotation-scale invariant descriptors- SIFT, Hu Moments with HOG to improve 
        performance with The Sketchy Database. Along with this, we may try options like 
        query expansion discussed in the class, training ML/DL models with some/all of these features
